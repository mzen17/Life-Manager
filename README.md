# Life Manager

Life Manager is a web app to help you manage your life!

Powered by ReactJS, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Tailwindcss.

Keep tasks easy and simple with a full frontend to manage your assignments. Note: You must have docker and docker compose installed.
To start, run 

`git clone https://github.com/starlightpath/lifemr.git && cd lifemr`

`docker compose up -d` 

to gain a working app.

I am planning to add many features next, such as direct integration with Canvas LMS, Infinite Campus, and others for managing all grades, assignments, and whatever all in one place.
